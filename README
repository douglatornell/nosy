Introduction
============

Run the nose_ test discovery and execution tool whenever a source file
is changed.

An elaborated version of Jeff Winkler's nosy_ tool that runs nose
whenever a source file is changed.  This version has a command line
parser added, and the capability to use a configuration file to
control what files are watched, and how nose runs.

Synopsis
========

  $ nosy -h

  Usage: nosy [options]

  Automatically run nose whenever source files change.

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -c CONFIG_FILE, --config=CONFIG_FILE
			  Configuration file path and name

Configuration File
==================

Configuration file contents example:

  [nosy]
  # Paths to check for changed files; changes cause nose to be run
  paths = *.py tests/*.py tests/nosy.cfg
  # Command line options to pass to nose
  options = -s
  # Command line arguments to pass to nose; e.g. part of test suite to run
  tests = tests/unit_tests.py

Configuration file is read by a Python standard library ConfigParser
object, so:

  * Lines beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to
    provide comments.
  * Entries can be in the form "name: value" or "name=value", with
    continuations in the style of RFC 822.
  * Leading whitespace is removed from values.
  * Format string substitution in values is supported.

The file can have 1 section `[nosy]`.  Within that section 3 options
can be specified:

  * `paths` - A whitespace separated list of paths to check for
    changed files; wildcard characters are globbed.  Defaults to
    `*.py`.
  * `options` - A string of options to be passed through to nose when
    it is executed.
  * `tests` - A string of command line arguments to be passed through
    to nose when it is executed.  Useful for specifying part of the
    test suite to run.

Including the configuration file in the `paths` option list allows you
to change nose's behaviour on the fly.
